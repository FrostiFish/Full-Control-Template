    "Before starting any 3D print, it is important to verify a printer extrudes the requested amount of plastic. This is usually done by marking 100mm of filament and accordingly request 100mm of filament to be extruded by your printer. You can now calculate the percentual difference in actual and requested extrusion rate. This is then used to recalculate the printer's e-steps(Marlin) or `rotation_distance`(Klipper). For a complete guide on tuning a 3D printer's extruder, refer to [Extruder Calibration](https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/articles/extruder_calibration.html) by Ellis3DP"
